# My guess before looking at documentation/solution:

# Input:
  # N/A

# Output:
  # output all even numbers from 1 to 99 inclusive, with each number on a separate line

# Rules / assumptions:
  # N/A

# Data structure:
  # N/A

# Algorithm:
  # 1. Repeat from 1 to 99 inclusive:
      # 1. If the current number is even, output it to the screen (on its own separate line)

1.upto(99) { |num| puts num if num.even? }

# After looking at solution:
# My solution works! :)
# The LS solution uses a while loop.
