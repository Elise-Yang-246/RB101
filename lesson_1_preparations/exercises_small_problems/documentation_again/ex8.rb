# a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
# puts a.min

# Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values in the Array.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My guess before looking at solution:

a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min(2)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After looking at solution:
# Yes! :)
# Note: Try looking at Included Modules if can't find a method in the Class or Parent
