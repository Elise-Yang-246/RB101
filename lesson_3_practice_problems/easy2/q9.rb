# Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:

statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# I assume there's a method to count the number of repetitions of a certain character in a string, but I can't remember the method name.
# After looking at documentation:
#   String#count was the method I was thinking of.

p statement.count("t")

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# After looking at solution
# Yes! :)
